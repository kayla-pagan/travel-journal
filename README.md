# travel-journal

I wanted to use this project as an opportunity to improve on my React skills.
I learned about the importance of Props in react which made it SO much easier
to reuse my components instead of hard coding values inside of them.

Also this gave me a chance to showcase some of the places I have traveled to so
far as I plan to start traveling more often now that the pandemic is over with!
